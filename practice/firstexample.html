<p> 
    This picture is from my 152 lbs bout at the 2022 PA District 3 team duels championship. I won this match 16-5, en route to our team winning the duel 32-30.
    This was essentially the culmination of my wrestling career, starting as a Freshman with no wrestling experience and ending my senior year with a 31-8 record. 
    As a new wrestler, I had to pick up what is a hyper competitive sport in just a couple of years. I succeeded in this by basically living the sport save for baseball season.
    By foregoing care about the outcomes and simply working hard in an environment I learned early rewarded it, I was able to become a solid wrestler.
